# config_reader  
This is a more personal project for when I want to read config files, something I have had to do on a case by case basis before.  
  
This is meant to be simple config files so that parameters don't get to intense. This is more meant for personal projects, such as the tarrasch editor (you can find (here){github.com/pawnlord/tarrasch-editor}).
